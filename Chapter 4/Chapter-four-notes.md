# Chapter 4 notes - How objects behave: Methods use instance variables

A class is a blueprint for an object.
Objects have **state** (instance variables) and **behavior** (methods). Each object (or instance of a class) can have its own unique values for its instance variables.

**Methods** use the values stored in the instance variables.

Every instance of a particular class will have the same methods, but these methods will **behave differently** depending on the instance variables of that object.

## You can send things to a method
A **method** takes **arguments or parameters** or can be passed **arguments or parameters** by the caller. 

A **parameter** is a local variable with a **type** and **name** that can be used inside the body of the method.

If a method takes a parameter, this parameter **must** be passed when the method is called, and its value **must** be of the **appropriate type**.

```java
void sayHello(int numOfTimes) {
  while (numOfTimes > 0) {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    numOfTimes = numOfTimes - 1;
  }
}
```

## You can get things back from a method

Methods can **return** values.
If the method has a **void return type**, it means they don't give anything back.
`void run() {}`

We can declare a method to return a specific type of value back to the caller:
`int numberOfEyes() { return 2; }`

If a method is declared to return a value of a particular type, they **must** return such value or a compatible one.

You can pass a byte where an int is expected, because the byte fits into the int the caller will use for assigning the result. Values passed in and out of methods can be **implicitly promoted** to a larger type or **explicitly cast** to a smaller type.

## Getters and setters
Getters and setters are methods that allow us to get and set instance variables.

```java
class Cats {
    String name;
    int age;

    String getName() { // Getter
        return name;
    }

    void setAge(int catsAge) { // Setter
        age = catsAge; 
    }
}
```

## Encapsulation

When an instance variable is exposed, we mean that it is reachable with the dot operator: `myCat.name = "Luna";`

This allows other methods to change the instance variables directly, which is not good practice. That is why we need to build setter methods, which will allow us to **set limitations for our instance variables** through those methods:

```java
public void setAge(int catsAge) {
    if (catsAge < 30) {
        age = catsAge;
    }
}
```

We can hide our data using the **public and private access modifiers**.
As a general rule, a good practice is to mark all **instance variables** as **private** and provide **public getters and setters** for access control.

### Declaring and initializing instance variables
Instance variables always get a default value if we don't assign it one:

|var type | default value|
|----|----|
|integers| 0|
|floating points| 0.0 |
|booleans| false |
|strings| null|
|references| null|

### Difference between instance and local variables

* **Instance variables** are **declared inside a class**, but not inside a method.
* **Local variables** are **declared within a method**, and **MUST be initialized** before use.
* **Method parameters** also need to be declared inside the method.
* **Instance variables** are assigned values by default, **local variables** are not, we always need to initialize them.

## Comparing variables (primitives or references)
To **compare** if two primitives are the same, or if two reference variables refer to a single object on the heap, we can use "==".

But sometimes we want to check if **two objects are equal**, and in this case we need to use the `.equals()` method.

The idea of equality fepends on the type of object. For example, if two strings have exactly the same word, they are equivalent despite being different objects on the heap. It can be more complicated for other types of objects.
